## [Unreleased]

### Changed

  - `Timber.InvalidAPIKeyError` is now `Timber.Errors.InvalidAPIKeyError`
  - Events are no longer nested under the `event` key.
  - Custom events are no longer nested under the `event.custom` key, they have simply been moved
    to the root of the document.
  - Custom contexts are no longer nested under the `context.custom` key, they have simply been
    moved to the root of the document.
  - JSON representations of log events no longer include the `$schema` key since Timber 2.0
    does not strictly require a schema anymore.
  - All `Timber.Events.*` and `Timber.Contexts.*` structs have been deprecated in favor of
    simple maps since Timber 2.0 no longer requires a strict schema. Module docs for each
    module has been updated accordingly.
  - Errors are no longer automatically parsed in the logger backend. Please use the
    [`:timber_exceptions`](https://github.com/timberio/timber-elixir-exceptions) library if you'd
    like to structure errors. This is a proper approach to structuring these events.
