### Fixed

  - Fixed a bug within the installer where HTTP log delivery was being used on platforms that
    should use STDOUT / :console.

### Added

  - Support for blacklisting controller actions with
    `Timber.Integrations.PhoenixInstrumentater`. This will suppress log lines
    from being written for any controller/action pair.
