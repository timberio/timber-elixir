## [Unreleased]
### Fixed

  - `Timber.Events.HTTPRepsonseEvent` no longer enforces the `:time_ms` key on
    the struct. This brings it in line with the specification

## [2.5.4] - 2017-09-18

### Fixed

  - Fixed a bug within the installer where HTTP log delivery was being used on platforms that
    should use STDOUT / :console.

### Added

  - Support for blacklisting controller actions with
    `Timber.Integrations.PhoenixInstrumentater`. This will suppress log lines
    from being written for any controller/action pair.
