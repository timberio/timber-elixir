defmodule Timber.LoggerBackends.HTTP do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides a logger backend that dispatches logs via HTTP

  The HTTP backend buffers and delivers log messages over HTTP to the Timber API.
  It uses batching and msgpack to deliver logs with high-throughput and little overhead.

  Note: We use this transport strategy internally at Timber for our log ingestion pipeline;
  generating ~250 logs per second with virtually no change in performance. For the curious,
  we log metrics, and this is how we are able to optimize our pipeline.

  Messages are always written to the buffer first. The buffer is only drained when it reaches
  its maximum allowed size or a specified amount of time has elapsed. This balances output with
  batching so that logs are sent even when the application doesn't produce enough logs to fill
  the buffer.

  The maximum allowed size of the buffer can be controlled with the `:max_buffer_size` configuration
  value.

  All outgoing requests are made asynchronously. If a second request is made while the
  previous (first) request is still being processed, then the transport will enter
  synchronous mode, waiting for a response before proceeding with the request.
  Synchronous mode will cause any logging calls to block until the request completes.
