    Great! Timber can track all of your outgoing HTTP requests and
    responses. You'll have access to the body contents, headers,

    to solve an issue when it arises.

    To install, please add this code wherever you issue HTTP requests:

        Timber.Events.HTTPClient.log(method, headers, url, :stripe, fn ->
          :hackney.request(method, path) # just an example, use any HTTP client you want
