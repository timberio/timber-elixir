Timber solves Elixir insight by leveraging what you already have: the `Logger`. There are
no agents or special APIs; it's just better logging. Timber gives you a _complete_ set of events
so you'll always have the data you need to _efficiently_ resolve issues. Never feel lost again.

* [Library documentation](https://hex.pm/packages/timber)
* [Support](mailto:support@timber.io)


## Overview

Timber for Elixir pairs with the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io) to provide a complete
structured logging system. Automatically turning your raw text logs into rich structured events.
This gives you _complete_ insight into your application, allowing you to query, graph, and alert
on log data.

For example, it turns this:

```
Sent 200 in 45.ms
```

Into this:

```
Sent 200 in 45.2ms @metadata {"dt": "2017-02-02T01:33:21.154345Z", "level": "info", "context": {"user": {"id": 1}, "http": {"method": "GET", "host": "timber.io", "path": "/path"}}, "event": {"http_response": {"status": 200, "time_ms": 45.2}}}
```

Allowing you to alert, graph, and run queries like:

1. `context.request_id:abcd1234` - View all logs generated for a specific request
2. `context.user.id:1` - View logs generated by a specific user.
3. `type:exception` - View all exceptions with the ability to zoom out and view them in context (request, user, etc).
4. `http_server_response.time_ms:>=1000` - View slow responses with the ability to zoom out and view them in context (request, user, etc).


## Installation

1. Add `timber` as a dependency in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    # Mix.exs

    def application do
      [applications: [:timber]]
    end

    def deps do
      [{:timber, "~> 1.0"}]
    end
    ```

2. Run `mix deps.get` in your shell.

3. Run `mix timber.install your-timber-app-api-key`

    * You can obtain your API key by [adding your application within Timber](https://app.timber.io). Each app has it's own unique API key.


## Usage

<details><summary><strong>Basic logging</strong></summary><p>

No special API, Timber works directly with `Logger`:

```elixir
Logger.info("My log message")

# My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}
```

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Tagging logs</strong></summary><p>

Tags provide a quick way to categorize logs and make them easier to search:

```elixir
Logger.info("My log message", tags: ["tag"])

# My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "tags": ["tag"], "context": {...}}
```

* In the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io) use the query: `tags:tag`.

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Timings</strong></summary><p>

Timings allow you to capture code execution time:

```elixir
timer = Timber.start_timer()
# ... code to time ...
time_ms = Timber.duration_ms(timer)
Logger.info("Task complete", tags: ["my_task"] time_ms: time_ms)

# Task complete @metadata {"level": "info", "tags": ["my_task"], "time_ms": 56.4324, "context": {...}}
```

* In the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io) use the query: `tags:my_task time_ms>500`

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Custom events</strong></summary><p>

Custom events allow you to capture events central to your line of business like receiving
credit card payments, saving a draft of a post, or changing a user's password.

Note: before logging a custom event, checkout [`Timber.Events`](lib/timber/events) to make
sure it doesn't already exist.

1. Log a map (simplest)

  ```elixir
  event_data = %{customer_id: "xiaus1934", amount: 1900, currency: "USD"}
  Logger.info("Payment rejected", event: %{payment_rejected: event_data})

  # Payment rejected @metadata {"level": "warn", "event": {"payment_rejected": {"customer_id": "xiaus1934", "amount": 100, "reason": "Card expired"}}, "context": {...}}
  ```

2. Or, log a struct (recommended)

  ```elixir
  def PaymentRejectedEvent do
    use Timber.Events.CustomEvent, type: :payment_rejected

    @enforce_keys [:customer_id, :amount, :currency]
    defstruct [:customer_id, :amount, :currency]

    def message(%__MODULE__{customer_id: customer_id}) do
      "Payment rejected for #{customer_id}"
    end
  end

  event = %PaymentRejectedEvent{customer_id: "xiaus1934", amount: 1900, currency: "USD"}
  message = PaymentRejectedEvent.message(event)
  Logger.info(message, event: event)

  # Payment rejected @metadata {"level": "warn", "event": {"payment_rejected": {"customer_id": "xiaus1934", "amount": 100, "reason": "Card expired"}}, "context": {...}}
  ```

* In the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io) use the query:
  `payment_rejected.customer_id:xiaus1934` or `payment_rejected.amount>100`


#### What about regular Hashes, JSON, or logfmt?

Go for it! Timber will parse the data server side. If the event is meaningful in any way we
_highly_ recommend using custom events (see above).

```ruby
Logger.info(%{key: "value"})
# {"key": "value"} @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}

Logger.info('{"key": "value"}')
# {"key": "value"} @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}

Logger.info("key=value")
# key=value @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}
```

* In the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io) use the query: `key:value`

<details><summary><strong>Custom contexts</strong></summary><p>

Context is additional data shared across log lines. Think of it like log join data.

1. Add a map (simplest)

  ```elixir
  Timber.add_context(%{build: %{version: "1.0.0"}})
  Logger.info("My log message")

  # My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {"build": {"version": "1.0.0"}}}
  ```

2. Add a struct (recommended)

  ```elixir
  def BuildContext do
    use Timber.Contexts.CustomContext, type: :build
    @enforce_keys [:version]
    defstruct [:version]
  end

  Timber.add_context(%BuildContext{version: "1.0.0"})
  Loger.info("My log message")

  # My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {"build": {"version": "1.0.0"}}}
  ```

* In the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io) use the query: `build.version:1.0.0`

</p></details>


## Jibber-Jabber

<details><summary><strong>Which log events does Timber structure for me?</strong></summary><p>

Out of the box you get everything in the [`Timber.Events`](lib/timber/events) namespace.

We also add context to every log, everything in the [`Timber.Contexts`](lib/timber/contexts)
namespace. Context is structured data representing the current environment when the log line
was written. It is included in every log line. Think of it like join data for your logs.

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>What about my current log statements?</strong></summary><p>

They'll continue to work as expected. Timber adheres strictly to the default `Logger` interface
and will never deviate in *any* way.

In fact, traditional log statements for non-meaningful events, debug statements, etc, are
encouraged. In cases where the data is meaningful, consider [logging a custom event](#usage).

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>How is Timber different?</strong></summary><p>

1. **No lock-in**. Timber is just _better_ logging. There are no agents or special APIs. This means
   no risk of vendor lock-in, code debt, or performance issues.
2. **Data quality.** Instead of relying on parsing alone, Timber ships libraries that structure
   and augment your logs from _within_ your application. Improving your log data at the source.
3. **Human readability.** Structuring your logs doesn't have to mean losing readability. Instead,
   Timber _augments_ your logs. For example: `log message @metadata {...}`. And when you view
   your logs in the [Timber console](https://app.timber.io), you'll see the human friendly messages
   with the ability to view the associated metadata.
4. **Sane prices, long retention**. Logging is notoriously expensive with low retention. Timber
   is affordable and offers _6 months_ of retention by default.
5. **Normalized schema.** Have multiple apps? All of Timber's libraries adhere to our
   [JSON schema](https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema). This means queries, alerts,
   and graphs for your ruby app can also be applied to your elixir app (for example).
