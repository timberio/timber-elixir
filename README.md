Logs are great...when they're structured. And unless your a logging company, designing and
implementing a structured logging strategy can be a time sink. Not only do you have to deal
with 3rd party libraries, but you need to agree on a schema and a standard your team will adhere
to across *all* of your apps.

Timber gives you this today by automatically structuring and adding context to you logs.
We also built a beautiful modern console designed specifically for this data. *And*, we
give you *6 months* of retention at a price cheaper than any alternative. *And*, we don't charge
you extra for the structured data we're encouraging here. *And* your data is encrypted with
11 9s of durability. And...so many things!

Timber's goal is to remove *any* barrier that gets in the way of realizing the power of structured
logging.

## What events does Timber structure for me?

Out of the box you get everything in the `Timber.Events` namespace:

1. [Controller Call Event]()
2. [Exception Event]()
3. [Outgoing HTTP Request Event]()
4. [Outgoing HTTP Response Event]()
5. [Incoming HTTP Request Event]()
6. [Incoming HTTP Response Event]()
7. [SQL Query Event]()
8. [Template Render Event]()
9. ...more coming soon, [file an issue](https://github.com/timberio/timber-elixir/issues) to request.

We also add context to every line, everything in the `Timber.Contexts` namespace:

1. [HTTP Context]()
2. [Organization Context]()
3. [Process Context]()
4. [Server Context]()
5. [Runtime Context]()
6. ...more coming soon, [file an issue](https://github.com/timberio/timber-elixir/issues) to request.


## What about custom events?

No probs! We've put careful thought in how this would be implemented. You have a couple of options
depending on how strict you want to be with structuring your data.

1. Log a map (simplest)

  ```elixir
  event_data = %{customer_id: "xiaus1934", amount: 1900, currency: "USD"}
  Logger.info("Payment rejected", event: %{type: :payment_rejected, data: event_data})
  ```

2. Log a struct (recommended)

  Defining structs for your important events just feels oh so good :) It creates a strong contract
  with down stream consumers and gives you compile time guarantees.

  ```elixir
  def PaymentRejectedEvent do
    use Timber.Events.CustomEvent, type: :payment_rejected

    @enforce_keys [:customer_id, :amount, :currency]
    defstruct [:customer_id, :amount, :currency]

    def message(%__MODULE__{customer_id: customer_id}) do
      "Payment rejected for #{customer_id}"
    end
  end

  event = %PaymentRejectedEvent{customer_id: "xiaus1934", amount: 1900, currency: "USD"}
  message = PaymentRejectedEvent.message(event)
  Logger.info(message, event: event)
  ```

Notice there are no special APIs, no risk of code-debt, and no lock-in. Just better logging.


## Installation

1. Add Timber as a dependency:

  ```elixir
  # Mix.exs

  def application do
    [applications: [:timber]]
  end

  def deps do
    [{:timber, "~> 0.4"}]
  end
  ```

2. Configure Timber:

  ```elixir
  # config/config.exs

  config :logger,
    backends: [Timber.LoggerBackend],
    handle_otp_reports: false # Timber handles this and adds additional metadata

  config :timber, :capture_errors, true
  ```

3. Install the Timber plugs:

  1. Remove the existing `Plug.Logger`:

    ```elixir
    # lib/my_app/endpoint.ex

    plug Plug.Logger # <--- REMOVE ME
    ```

  2. Add the Timber plugs:

    ```elixir
    # web/router.ex

    defmodule MyApp.Router do
      use MyApp.Web, :router

      pipeline :logging do
        plug Timber.Integrations.ContextPlug
        plug Timber.Integrations.EventPlug
      end

      scope "/api", MyApp do
        pipe_through :logging
      end
    end
    ```

    * To learn more about what each of these plugs are doing, checkout the docs:
      [Timber.Integrations.ContextPlug](lib/timber/integrations/context_plug.ex) and
      [Timber.Integrations.EventPlug](lib/timber/integrations/event_plug.ex)

4. Add Phoenix instrumentation:

  Skip if you are not using `Phoenix`.

  ```elixir
  # config/config.exs

  config :my_app, MyApp.Endpoint,
    http: [port: 4001],
    root: Path.dirname(__DIR__),
    instrumenters: [Timber.Integrations.PhoenixInstrumenter], # <------
    pubsub: [name: MyApp.PubSub,
             adapter: Pheonix.PubSub.PG2]
  ```

5. Add the Ecto logger:

  Skip if you are not using `Ecto`.

  ```elixir
  # config/config.exs

  config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
    loggers: [{Timber.Integrations.EctoLogger, :log, [:info]}] # Bump to info to gain more insight
  ```


## Transport Installation

We *highly* recommend that you obtain these transport instructions from within
[the Timber app](https://app.timber.io). During the app creation process we collect details
about your app, and at the end, we provide you with simple, copy-paste, instructions for your
exact environment (API key included).


### STDOUT

Do nothing! This is the default transport strategy.

### File

1. Configure the Timber transport strategy:

  ```elixir
  config :timber, :transport, Timber.Transports.IODevice
  config :timber, :io_device,
    file: "path/to/file",
  ```

### HTTP

Coming soon!


## Development environment

Bonus points! Use Timber in your development environment so you can see context locally:

```elixir
# config/dev.exs

config :timber, :io_device,
  colorize: true,
  format: :logfmt,
  print_timestamps: true
  print_log_level: true
```
