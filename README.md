Still logging raw text? Timber is a complete *structured* logging solution that you can setup in
minutes. It goes beyond traditional log management by focusing on data quality and modern
developer standards.

High quality logs, [a modern UX-first interface](https://timber.io), simple setup,
zero-maintenance, 6-month retention, and sane prices are just a few of the benefits Timber
offers.

To learn more, checkout out [timber.io](https://timber.io) or the
["why we built Timber"](http://moss-ibex2.cloudvent.net/blog/why-were-building-timber/)
blog post.


## Overview

<details><summary><strong>What are the benefits of using Timber?</strong></summary><p>

1. **Data quality.** The usefulness of your logs starts here. This is why we ship libraries that
   structure logs from *within* your application; a fundamental difference from parsing. Not only
   is it much more stable, but we can include data you couldn't obtain otherwise.
2. **Human readability.** Structuring your logs doesn't mean they have to be unreadable. Timber
   *augments* your logs with structured data. Meaning we do not alter the original log message,
   we simply attach metadata to it. And our console is specifically designed to give you access
   to this data, without compromising readability. ðŸ˜®
3. **Reliable downstream consumption.** All log events adhere to a
   [normalized, shared, schema](https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema) that follows
   [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) and goes through a [standard release process](https://github.com/timberio/log-event-json-schema/releases).
   This means you can *rely* on the structure of your logs and interact consistently with them
   across apps of any language: queries, graphs, alerts, and other downstream consumers.
4. **Zero risk of code debt or lock-in.** Logging is a standard that has been around since the dawn
   of computers. It's built into every language, framework, and library. Timber adheres strictly
   to the default `Logger` interface. There are no special APIs, and no need to pepper your app
   with Timber specific code. It's just better logging. If you choose to stop using Timber, you
   can do so without consequence.
5. **Long term retention.** Timber is designed on modern big-data principles. As a result, we can
   offer 6+ months of retention at prices cheaper than alternatives offering <1 month.
   This allows you to unlock your logs for purposes beyond debugging.

<details><summary><strong>What specifically does the Timber library do?</strong></summary><p>

1. Captures and structures your framework and 3rd party logs. (see next question)
2. Adds useful context to every log line. (see next question)
3. Allows you to easily add tags and timings to log. (see [Usage](#usage))
4. Provides a framework for logging custom structured events. (see [Usage](#usage))
5. Offers transport strategies to [send your logs](#send-your-logs) to the Timber service.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>What events does Timber capture & structure for me?</strong></summary><p>

Out of the box you get everything in the [`Timber.Events`](lib/timber/events) namespace:

1. [Controller Call Event](lib/timber/events/controller_call_event.ex)
2. [Exception Event](lib/timber/events/exception_event.ex)
3. [HTTP Client Request Event (outgoing)](lib/timber/events/http_client_request_event.ex)
4. [HTTP Client Response Event](lib/timber/events/http_client_response_event.ex)
5. [HTTP Server Request Event (incoming)](lib/timber/events/http_server_request_event.ex)
6. [HTTP Server Response Event](lib/timber/events/http_server_response_event.ex)
7. [SQL Query Event](lib/timber/events/sql_query_event.ex)
8. [Template Render Event](lib/timber/events/template_render_event.ex)
9. ...more coming soon, [file an issue](https://github.com/timberio/timber-elixir/issues) to request.

We also add context to every log, everything in the [`Timber.Contexts`](lib/timber/contexts)
namespace. Context is structured data representing the current environment when the log line was written.
It is included in every log line. Think of it like join data for your logs:

1. [HTTP Context](lib/timber/contexts/http_context.ex)
2. [Organization Context](lib/timber/contexts/organization_context.ex)
3. [Server Context](lib/timber/contexts/server_context.ex)
4. [System Context](lib/timber/contexts/system_context.ex)
5. [Runtime Context](lib/timber/contexts/runtime_context.ex)
5. [User Context](lib/timber/contexts/user_context.ex)
6. ...more coming soon, [file an issue](https://github.com/timberio/timber-elixir/issues) to request.

<details><summary><strong>What about my current log statements?</strong></summary><p>

They'll continue to work as expected. Timber adheres strictly to the default `Logger` interface
and will never deviate in *any* way.

In fact, traditional log statements for non-meaningful events, debug statements, etc, are
encouraged. In cases where the data is meaningful, consider [logging a custom event](#usage).

</p></details>

## Usage

<details><summary><strong>Basic logging</strong></summary><p>

No client, no special API, no magic, just use `Logger` as normal:

```elixir
Logger.info("My log message")

# My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}
```

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Tagging logs</strong></summary><p>

Tags provide a quick way to identify logs. They work just like any tagging system.
In the context of logging, they prevent obstructing the log message to
accomplish the same thing, while also being a step down from creating a classified custom
event. If the event is meaningful in any way, we recommend creating a custom event.

```elixir
Logger.info("My log message", tags: ["tag"])

# My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "tags": ["tag"], "context": {...}}
```

* In the Timber console use the query: `tags:tag`.

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Timings</strong></summary><p>

Timings allow you to easily capture one-off timings in your code; a simple
way to benchmark code execution:


```elixir
timer = Timber.start_timer()
# ... code to time ...
time_ms = Timber.duration_ms(timer)
Logger.info("Task complete", tags: ["my_task"] time_ms: time_ms)

# Task complete @metadata {"level": "info", "tags": ["my_task"], "time_ms": 56.4324, "context": {...}}
```

* In the Timber console use the query: `tags:my_task time_ms>500`
* The Timber console will also display this value inline with your logs. No need to include it
  in the log message, but you certainly can if you'd prefer.

---

<details><summary><strong>Custom events</strong></summary><p>

Custom events can be used to structure information about events that are central
to your line of business like receiving credit card payments, saving a draft of a post,
or changing a user's password. You have 2 options to do this:

1. Log a map (simplest)

  The simplest way to send an event and kick the tires:

  ```elixir
  event_data = %{customer_id: "xiaus1934", amount: 1900, currency: "USD"}
  Logger.info("Payment rejected", event: %{payment_rejected: event_data})

  # Payment rejected @metadata {"level": "warn", "event": {"payment_rejected": {"customer_id": "xiaus1934", "amount": 100, "reason": "Card expired"}}, "context": {...}}
  ```

2. Log a struct (recommended)

  Defining structs for your important events just feels oh so good :) It creates a strong contract
  with down stream consumers and gives you compile time guarantees.

  ```elixir
  def PaymentRejectedEvent do
    use Timber.Events.CustomEvent, type: :payment_rejected

    @enforce_keys [:customer_id, :amount, :currency]
    defstruct [:customer_id, :amount, :currency]

    def message(%__MODULE__{customer_id: customer_id}) do
      "Payment rejected for #{customer_id}"
    end
  end

  event = %PaymentRejectedEvent{customer_id: "xiaus1934", amount: 1900, currency: "USD"}
  message = PaymentRejectedEvent.message(event)
  Logger.info(message, event: event)

  # Payment rejected @metadata {"level": "warn", "event": {"payment_rejected": {"customer_id": "xiaus1934", "amount": 100, "reason": "Card expired"}}, "context": {...}}
  ```

* In the Timber console use queries like: `payment_rejected.customer_id:xiaus1934` or `payment_rejected.amount>100`
* Also, notice there is no mention of Timber in the above code. Just plain old logging.

#### What about regular Hashes, JSON, or logfmt?

Go for it! Timber will parse the data server side, but we *highly* recommend the above examples.
Providing a `:type` allows timber to classify the event, create a namespace for the data you
send, and make it easier to search, graph, alert, etc.

```ruby
Logger.info(%{key: "value"})
# {"key": "value"} @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}

Logger.info('{"key": "value"}')
# {"key": "value"} @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}

Logger.info("key=value")
# key=value @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {...}}
```

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>Custom contexts</strong></summary><p>

Context is additional data shared across log lines. Think of it like join data. For example, the
`http.request_id` is included in the context, allowing you to view all log lines related to that
request ID. Not just the lines that contain the value.

1. Add a map (simplest)

  The simplest way to add context is:

  ```elixir
  Timber.add_context(%{build: %{version: "1.0.0"}})
  Logger.info("My log message")

  # My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {"build": {"version": "1.0.0"}}}
  ```

  This adds context data keyspaces by `build`.

2. Add a struct (recommended)

  Just like events, we recommend defining your custom contexts. It makes a stronger contract
  with downstream consumers.

  ```elixir
  def BuildContext do
    use Timber.Contexts.CustomContext, type: :build
    @enforce_keys [:version]
    defstruct [:version]
  end

  Timber.add_context(%BuildContext{version: "1.0.0"})
  Loger.info("My log message")

  # My log message @metadata {"level": "info", "context": {"build": {"version": "1.0.0"}}}
  ```

* In the Timber console use a query like: `context.build.version:1.0.0`

## Installation

```elixir
# Mix.exs

def application do
  [applications: [:timber]]
end

def deps do
  [{:timber, "~> 1.0"}]
end
```


## Setup

ðŸ‘‰ **Prefer examples?** Checkout out the **[Timber install example pull requst](https://github.com/timberio/elixir-phoenix-example-app/pull/1/files)**.
This demonstrates the below changes for a default Phoenix application.

---

<details><summary><strong>1. *Configure* Timber in `config/config.exs`</strong></summary><p>

Replace *any* existing `config :logger` calls with:

```elixir
# config/config.exs

config :logger,
  backends: [Timber.LoggerBackend],
  handle_otp_reports: false # Timber handles errors, structures them, and adds additional metadata

config :timber, :capture_errors, true
```

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>2. *Capture* `Plug` logging in `lib/my_app/endpoint.ex`</strong></summary><p>

ðŸ‘‰ *Skip if you are not using `Plug`.*

```elixir
# lib/my_app/endpoint.ex

plug Plug.Logger # <--- REMOVE THIS LINE

...

# ADD THESE LINES
# Insert at the bottom, immediately before `plug MyApp.Router`
plug Timber.Integrations.ContextPlug
plug Timber.Integrations.EventPlug

plug MyApp.Router
```

* Be sure to insert these plugs at the bottom of your `endpoint.ex` file, *immediately* before
  `plug MyApp.Router`. This ensures Timber captures the request ID and other useful context.

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>3. *Capture* `Phoenix` logging in `config/config.exs` and `my_app/web.ex`</strong></summary><p>

ðŸ‘‰ *Skip if you are not using `Phoenix`.*

```elixir
# config/config.exs

config :my_app, MyApp.Endpoint,
  instrumenters: [Timber.Integrations.PhoenixInstrumenter]
```

Now that Timber is handling logging, disable Phoenix logging with:

```elixir
# my_app/web.ex

def controller do
  quote do
    use Phoenix.Controller, log: false # <--- Add log: false
  end
end
```

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>4. *Capture* `Ecto` logging in `config/config.exs`</strong></summary><p>

ðŸ‘‰ *Skip if you are not using `Ecto`.*

```elixir
# config/config.exs

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  loggers: [{Timber.Integrations.EctoLogger, :log, [:info]}]
```

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>5. (optional) *Configure* Timber for development in `config/dev.exs`</strong></summary><p>

Now that Timber is all set up, we want to make sure it's development friendly:

```elixir
# config/dev.exs

config :timber, :io_device,
  colorize: true,
  format: :logfmt,
  print_timestamps: true,
  print_log_level: true,
  print_metadata: false
```

</p></details>


## Send your logs

<details><summary><strong>Heroku (log drains)</strong></summary><p>

The recommended strategy for Heroku is to setup a
[log drain](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains). To get your Timber log drain URL:

ðŸ‘‰ **[Add your app to Timber](https://app.timber.io)**

---

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>All other platforms (Network / HTTP)</strong></summary><p>

ðŸ‘‰ **Prefer examples?** Checkout out the **[Timber HTTP install example pull requst](https://github.com/timberio/elixir-phoenix-example-app/pull/2/files)**.
This demonstrates *only* the changes below for a default Phoenix application.

1. *Add* HTTP dependencies to `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  # Elixir >= 1.4? Adding the applications list is optional.
  def application do
    [applications: [:hackney, :timber]] # <-- Be sure to add hackney!
  end

  def deps do
    [
      {:timber, "~> 1.0"},
      {:hackney, "~> 1.6"} # <-- ADD ME
    ]
  end
  ```

  * Prefer a different HTTP client? Checkout
    [Timber.Transports.HTTP.Client](lib/timber/transports/http/client.ex) for details on
    implementing your own client.

2. *Configure* Timber to use the HTTP transport in `config/config.exs`:

  ```elixir
  # config/config.exs

  config :timber,
    transport: Timber.Transports.HTTP,
    api_key: System.get_env("TIMBER_LOGS_KEY"),
    http_client: Timber.Transports.HTTP.HackneyClient
  ```

3. Obtain your Timber API :key: by **[adding your app in Timber](https://app.timber.io)**.

4. Assign your API key to the `TIMBER_LOGS_KEY` environment variable.
